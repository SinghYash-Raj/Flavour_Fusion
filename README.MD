# Forkify - A Recipe Search and Management Application

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the food2fork API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7, and ES8 back to ES5. With Forkify, you can search for specific recipes, add ingredients to a shopping list, or save recipes to a favorites list via local storage. Additionally, a simple Express server is provided to host the app via Heroku.
